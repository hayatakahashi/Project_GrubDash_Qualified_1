/* 
Example of const { data = null } = req.body

In Express.js, req.body contains parsed data from the body of the incoming HTTP request. The shape and content of req.body depend on the client's request, specifically the body content and the Content-Type header.

For example, if a client sends an HTTP POST request with a body containing JSON data and specifies the Content-Type as application/json, and if you're using middleware like express.json(), then req.body will contain the parsed JavaScript object from the JSON string sent by the client.

Here's a simple example:

Client sends this HTTP request:

POST /orders HTTP/1.1
Host: yourwebsite.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "deliverTo": "123 Main St.",
    "mobileNumber": "555-555-5555",
    "dishes": [
      {
        "id": "d1",
        "name": "Spaghetti",
        "quantity": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}

In your Express server, the content of req.body would then be:

{
  data: {
    deliverTo: "123 Main St.",
    mobileNumber: "555-555-5555",
    dishes: [
      {
        id: "d1",
        name: "Spaghetti",
        quantity: 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
Keep in mind that for req.body to work properly in Express and have the content parsed, you need to use appropriate middleware. For JSON data, it's common to use:

const express = require('express');
const app = express(); (This is already included in the app.js in this project.)

app.use(express.json()); // This middleware parses incoming JSON payloads.
